# Bevy 3.1.0-beta.9

## Highlights
- Republished the async-aware injection system introduced in beta.8 to guarantee PyPI now ships the latest code.
- Keeps the streamlined `InjectableCallable` flow so containers consistently orchestrate dependency resolution.
- Retains expanded auto-injection coverage across instance, class, and static methods for parity with the docs.
