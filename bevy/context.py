"""Bevy's Contexts manage tracking instances that have been created and injecting the necessary dependencies when new
instances are created.

Contexts

Bevy provides a basic context type. The standard context will add any object to its repository and inject them when
necessary. The context will only attempt to inject into objects being instantiated that inherit from bevy.Injectable.

Injection

All the basic context types built into Bevy handle injection by using a metaclass which overrides the object type's
dunder call method. It then adds a step between dunder new being called and dunder init, in this step it injects the
dependencies. So if a class defines a dunder new it will not have access to any attributes that need to be injected.
When dunder init is called all injections will have been made.

Using a metaclass allows for the class instantiation lifecycle to be modified without ever having to change the
structure of the classes themselves. Bevy doesn't require any state to be stored on a class object and it never needs to
inject anything that isn't specifically defined in the class definition. So Bevy has no impact on the memory foot print
of class objects or on the performance of the class after it's been instantiated.

Injecting The Context

If an object needs access to the context that created it (useful for branching or adding instantiated dependencies) it's
possible to just add an annotation for any subclass of BaseContext. Here's an example:

    class Example(Injectable):
        context: Context

Repository

The context stores every instance that's been created as a dependency in a repository. When a class is found that has a
dependency annotation Bevy checks the repository for any instances that are of the same type or that are a subclass of
that annotation. If no match is found it will create an instance by calling the type with no parameters.

If more advanced instantiation is required for a dependency it is possible to add an instance to the context using
Context.add. That will add the instance to the repository for use in injections. It is then possible to instantiate an
object with the context using Context.create. Here's an example:

    context = Context()
    context.add(PostgresDB(host, port, username, password, database))
    app = context.create(MyWebsiteApp, "My Website", "www.mywebsite.com")

That will add a postgres database object with the necessary connection details to the repository. It will then create an
instance of the MyWebsiteApp class with two parameters and any dependencies injected. Context.create will not add the
instance created to the repository, that can be accomplished by passing the returned instance to Context.add.

Repository Instance Conflicts

The context retrieves the first instance that passes an issubclass check. This means if there are two instances with a
shared MRO it will not be clearly defined which should be used if a super class of both is requested. To prevent this
from happening the context will raise ConflictingTypeAddedToRepository when an instance is added and it is the same
type, a super type of, or a sub type of any instanec already in the repository.

Branching

It is possible to branch a context. This will allow the dependencies on the root context to be used by the branch
context. Dependency instances created on the branch context however will not be available to the root context. This is
useful for preventing the dependencies of a plugin, for example, from polluting the root context and other plugins which
may have their own custom dependencies classes or may need a differently configured instance.

    The context then stores the instances used to fulfill the requirements in a repository so they can be used again if

    dependencies.

    Contexts also allow for pre-initialized instances to be added to the repository which will later be used to fulfill
    dependency requirements. This provides for more complex initialization of dependencies, such as for connecting to a
    database.

    Additionally each context has the ability to branch off sub-contexts. The context will share its dependency
    repository with the sub-contexts but any new dependencies created by the sub-contexts will not be propagated back.
    This allows for isolating objects that may have similar dependency requirements but that should have distinct
    dependency instances.

    The context can inject itself as a dependency if a class requires the context's type.

    The base Context type will only inject into objects that are derived from bevy.Injectable."""
