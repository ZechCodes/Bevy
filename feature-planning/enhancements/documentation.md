# Documentation Enhancement

## Current State
- Minimal documentation with only placeholder files
- `docs/index.md` and `docs/api.md` are nearly empty
- mkdocs.yml configured but references non-existent pages
- No code examples beyond README and QUICKSTART

## Issues Identified
- [ ] No comprehensive API reference documentation
- [ ] Missing conceptual guides and tutorials
- [ ] No examples for advanced features (hooks, containers, factories)
- [ ] No migration guides or best practices
- [ ] Missing troubleshooting documentation

## Options for Enhancement

### Option 1: Auto-generated API Documentation
- Use sphinx-autoapi or mkdocs-gen-files to generate from docstrings
- Requires adding comprehensive docstrings to all classes/functions
- Pros: Always up-to-date, less maintenance
- Cons: Less control over organization and examples

### Option 2: Hand-written Comprehensive Documentation
- Create detailed guides with examples for each feature
- Organize by user journey (getting started â†’ advanced features)
- Pros: Better organization, more examples, clearer explanations
- Cons: Higher maintenance burden

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Auto-generated API reference + hand-written guides
- Best of both worlds
- Recommended approach

## Suggested Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all public classes and methods
- [ ] Create proper API reference structure in `docs/api/`
- [ ] Set up auto-generation pipeline (sphinx-autoapi or similar)

### Phase 2: User Guides
- [ ] Create getting started tutorial with realistic examples
- [ ] Write conceptual guide explaining DI principles in Bevy
- [ ] Document hook system with examples for each hook type
- [ ] Create factory patterns guide
- [ ] Write container management guide (branching, lifecycle)

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics
- [ ] Performance optimization guide
- [ ] Testing strategies documentation
- [ ] Integration patterns with popular frameworks
- [ ] Troubleshooting common issues guide
- [ ] Migration guide for users coming from other DI frameworks

### Phase 4: Examples and Recipes
- [ ] Create example applications showing real-world usage
- [ ] Common patterns cookbook
- [ ] Anti-patterns and gotchas documentation
- [ ] FAQ section

## Priority: High
This is fundamental for user adoption and should be addressed first.

## Estimated Effort: Medium-High
Requires significant writing but is mostly content creation rather than code changes.
