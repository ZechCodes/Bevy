# Testing Utilities Enhancement

## Current State
- Minimal test coverage in the project
- No testing utilities or helpers provided
- Users must manually create test containers and mocks
- No integration with popular testing frameworks

## Issues Identified
- [ ] No testing utilities for mocking dependencies
- [ ] No test-specific container configurations
- [ ] No integration with pytest fixtures or unittest
- [ ] No utilities for testing factory behavior
- [ ] No support for test isolation and cleanup

## Options for Enhancement

### Option 1: Comprehensive Testing Framework
- Build full testing utilities with mocks, fixtures, and helpers
- Integrate with popular testing frameworks (pytest, unittest)
- Pros: Complete solution, excellent developer experience
- Cons: Large scope, maintenance burden

### Option 2: Basic Testing Utilities
- Provide essential utilities for common testing scenarios
- Focus on container isolation and simple mocking
- Pros: Manageable scope, immediate value
- Cons: May not cover all testing needs

### Option 3: Plugin-Based Testing
- Create plugin system for different testing frameworks
- Allow community contributions for specific frameworks
- Pros: Extensible, framework-agnostic
- Cons: More complex architecture

## Suggested Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Test Container Management
- [ ] Create `TestContainer` class with automatic cleanup
- [ ] Implement test-specific container isolation
- [ ] Add container state snapshot/restore functionality
- [ ] Support for test-scoped singletons

### Phase 2: Mocking and Stubbing
- [ ] Create `MockFactory` for creating test doubles
- [ ] Implement dependency stubbing utilities
- [ ] Add spy/mock verification helpers
- [ ] Support for partial mocking (some real, some mock dependencies)

### Phase 3: Testing Framework Integration
- [ ] Create pytest fixtures for container management
- [ ] Add unittest.TestCase base class with Bevy integration
- [ ] Implement dependency injection for test methods
- [ ] Add test discovery helpers

### Phase 4: Test Data and Factories
- [ ] Create test data factory utilities
- [ ] Add support for test data builders
- [ ] Implement fixture data management
- [ ] Support for test environment configuration

### Phase 5: Advanced Testing Features
- [ ] Add integration testing utilities
- [ ] Implement test performance profiling
- [ ] Create test coverage helpers for dependency usage
- [ ] Add test documentation generation

## Testing Utilities API Examples

### Test Container:
```python
import pytest
from bevy.testing import TestContainer

@pytest.fixture
def container():
    with TestContainer() as test_container:
        # Setup test dependencies
        test_container.register(MockUserService())
        yield test_container
    # Automatic cleanup

def test_user_controller(container):
    controller = container.get(UserController)
    assert controller.user_service is not None
```

### Dependency Mocking:
```python
from bevy.testing import mock_dependency

def test_with_mocked_service():
    with mock_dependency(UserService) as mock_service:
        mock_service.get_user.return_value = User(id=1, name="Test")
        
        controller = container.get(UserController)
        user = controller.get_current_user()
        
        assert user.name == "Test"
        mock_service.get_user.assert_called_once()
```

### Pytest Integration:
```python
from bevy.testing import inject_test

@inject_test
def test_user_operations(user_service: UserService, db: Database):
    # Dependencies automatically injected
    user = user_service.create_user("test@example.com")
    assert db.find_user(user.id) is not None
```

### Test Factory:
```python
from bevy.testing import TestFactory

class UserControllerTest(TestFactory):
    def setup(self):
        self.register(MockUserService())
        self.register(MockDatabase())
    
    def test_create_user(self):
        controller = self.get(UserController)
        # Test implementation
```

## Framework-Specific Features

### Pytest Integration:
- Custom fixtures for container management
- Dependency injection for test parameters
- Test discovery based on type annotations
- Automatic mock cleanup

### Unittest Integration:
- Base test case class with container setup
- setUp/tearDown integration
- Test method dependency injection
- Assertion helpers for dependency verification

## Best Practices Documentation
- Guidelines for testing with dependency injection
- Patterns for effective mocking
- Test organization strategies
- Performance testing considerations

## Priority: Medium
Important for adoption but not critical for core functionality.

## Estimated Effort: Medium-High
Requires integration with multiple testing frameworks and comprehensive utilities.
