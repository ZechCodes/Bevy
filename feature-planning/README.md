# Bevy Framework Feature Planning

This directory contains comprehensive analysis and planning for improving the Bevy dependency injection framework. The analysis identifies features that need enhancement, missing features, and complex features that are hard to understand.

## Directory Structure

### `/completed-features/` - Successfully Implemented Features
Features that have been fully implemented and deployed:

- **[Async Dependency Resolution](completed-features/async-dependency-resolution.md)** âœ… - Full async/await support with unified API

### `/enhancements/` - Features That Need Enhancement
Features that exist but could be significantly improved:

- **[Documentation](enhancements/documentation.md)** - Complete API documentation and user guides
- **[Error Handling](enhancements/error-handling.md)** - Better error messages with dependency chain context  
- **[Type Annotation Support](enhancements/type-annotation-support.md)** - Full typing support including generics and protocols
- **[Hook System](enhancements/hook-system.md)** - Priority system, lifecycle hooks, and management tools
- **[Async Hook Support](enhancements/async-hook-support.md)** ðŸ†• - Extend hooks to work with async dependency resolution
- **[Testing Utilities](enhancements/testing-utilities.md)** - Mocking, test containers, and framework integration

### `/missing-features/` - Features That Are Missing
Critical features expected in a mature DI framework:

- **[Lifecycle Management](missing-features/lifecycle-management.md)** - Instance disposal and resource cleanup
- **[Scoping and Lifetime](missing-features/scoping-and-lifetime.md)** - Request/session scopes, transient instances
- **[Async Support](missing-features/async-support.md)** - Additional async patterns beyond dependency resolution
- **[Configuration System](missing-features/configuration-system.md)** - Config binding, modules, auto-discovery
- **[Introspection and Debugging](missing-features/introspection-debugging.md)** - Container visualization and debugging tools

### `/complex-features/` - Features That Are Hard to Understand  
Existing features that cause confusion and need simplification:

- **[Container Branching](complex-features/container-branching.md)** - Parent-child container semantics
- **[Factory vs Hooks](complex-features/factory-vs-hooks.md)** - Overlapping responsibilities and unclear usage
- **[Global Context Management](complex-features/global-context-management.md)** - Implicit global state confusion
- **[Type Resolution Logic](complex-features/type-resolution-logic.md)** - Complex subclass checking and resolution paths
- **[Dependency Metadata](complex-features/dependency-metadata.md)** - Magic `dependency()` function behavior

## Priority Matrix

### High Priority (Critical for Production Use)
1. **Documentation** - Foundation for user adoption
2. **Error Handling** - Essential for debugging experience
3. **Async Hook Support** ðŸ†• - Complete async functionality (extends completed async dependency resolution)
4. **Lifecycle Management** - Critical for resource management
5. **Scoping and Lifetime** - Essential for web applications

### Medium-High Priority (Important for Maturity)
1. **Type Annotation Support** - Modern Python development standard
2. **Configuration System** - Important for large applications
3. **Container Branching Clarity** - Significant UX impact
4. **Factory vs Hooks Clarity** - API consistency important

### Medium Priority (Quality of Life)
1. **Introspection and Debugging** - Very useful for development
2. **Hook System Enhancement** - Useful for advanced users
3. **Global Context Management** - API clarity improvement
4. **Type Resolution Logic** - Debugging experience
5. **Testing Utilities** - Important for adoption

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Dependency Metadata** - API improvement but not critical

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4) 
- âœ… **Async dependency resolution** - COMPLETED
- **Async hook support** - Complete async functionality 
- Complete documentation system
- Enhanced error handling with dependency chains

### Phase 2: Core Features (Months 2-3)

- Scoping and lifetime management
- Container branching simplification

### Phase 3: Developer Experience (Months 5-6)
- Type annotation enhancements  
- Configuration and module system
- Factory vs hooks clarification

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Months 7-8)
- Introspection and debugging tools

- Performance optimization

### Phase 5: Polish (Months 9-10)
- Global context management improvements
- Type resolution logic cleanup
- Dependency metadata simplification

## Development Guidelines

### Before Starting Any Feature:
1. Read the relevant analysis document
2. Review the suggested implementation checklist
3. Consider backward compatibility impact
4. Plan migration strategy for breaking changes

### Implementation Principles:
- **Backward Compatibility**: Minimize breaking changes where possible
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Allow gradual adoption of new features
- **Clear Documentation**: Every feature needs comprehensive docs and examples
- **Testing**: Extensive test coverage for all new functionality
- **Performance**: Consider performance impact of all changes

### Quality Gates:
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Documentation with examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Migration guide for breaking changes
- [ ] IDE support considerations

## Estimated Effort Summary

| Category | Total Effort | High Priority Items |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Enhancements | Medium-High | Documentation, Error Handling |
| Missing Features | High | Lifecycle, Scoping, Async |
| Complex Features | Medium | Container Branching, Factory/Hooks |
| **Overall** | **High** | **10 months estimated** |

## Success Metrics

### User Experience:
- Reduced time to first successful injection
- Improved error message clarity (user surveys)
- Decreased confusion about API usage

### Framework Maturity:
- Feature parity with mature DI frameworks
- Production readiness indicators
- Community adoption metrics

### Code Quality:
- Test coverage >90%
- Documentation coverage 100%
- Performance benchmarks established

This analysis provides a roadmap for transforming Bevy from a promising DI framework into a production-ready, user-friendly solution that can compete with established alternatives.
